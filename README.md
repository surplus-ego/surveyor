* To Do
  * [ ] Find supplies.
  * [ ] You need to reset the aft Fergnatz glob cooling tank.
  * [ ] Isolate the CO2 scrubbers, it will increase the efficiency of the parabolic ion data core.

* Vf & Vi
  * Vf and Vi are the final and initial velocities, a is the acceleration, and d the distance. On our case, Vf = 0, since we want to “stop”, a is our maximum thrusters capabilities, 100 m/s if you’re using the modified Skylone, and d is the distance we are going to travel while decelerating. Solving for these values, we learn that d is close to 0.29 AU.

# day -1
Things are brutal here on the surface. I need to find a permanent source of food and water ASAP.

# day 0
Discovered indiginous, sentient life. There was an ... accident, and let's just say that their corpses are an excellent source of both food and water.  I've named them *Delectamenti*.  I have a choice to make: try to find alternate supplies, or ~~murder~~ *negotiate with* the *Delectamenti*.

# day 1
Fortune! Thanks to the *Delectamenti* I have enough food and water for the duration of my stay. The charged phase neutron rifle makes quick work of the squishy little guys.  You know what they say, "a fool and his money are soon parted." However, as the great text ponders: 
```
Would you rather have a permanently clogged nose or a piece of green food always stuck in your teeth?
